# Exercise: Grid Custom Module
In this exercise we will tackle a more complex layout using CSS Grid. We'll be executing the layouts in Wireframes.pdf (located in the Wireframes folder)

These layouts will require explicitly placing items on the grid using grid column number, grid row numbers, and the span keyword. You will also need to be familiar with the following:
- CSS Properties
	- display
	- grid-gap
	- grid-template columns
	- grid-column
	- grid-row
- CSS Units
	- fr
	- rem

## Tasks
- **Preview**: Take time to understand what it is that you actually need to do.
	- Wireframes.pdf indicates what the layouts should be as the screen size changes. The included screenshots can help you visualize what it will look like in the browser with the implemented typography.
	- Carefully review the HTML and the parent-child relationships. I recommend creating a little outline for yourself and/or annotating the wireframes with the markup that corresponds, including things like class names and IDs.
- **Small Screens**: Hint, you don't need to do anything. The small screen design is already done! This means that all grid code will be in media queries!
- **Medium Screens**: Implement the two column layout for the tertiary articles. The rest of the design remains a one column layout.
- **Large Screens**: Implement the three column layout for the module. This means that the tertiary articles go back to a single column.
- **Make Live**: Make sure before you publish your site that you have validated your code.

## Submission
On Blackboard submit the following:
- URL to live website
